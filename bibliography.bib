	abstract = {We develop a recently-proposed mapping of the two-dimensional Ising model with random exchange (RBIM), via the transfer matrix, to a network model for a disordered system of non-interacting fermions. The RBIM transforms in this way to a localisation problem belonging to one of a set of non-standard symmetry classes, known as class D; the transition between paramagnet and ferromagnet is equivalent to a delocalisation transition between an insulator and a quantum Hall conductor. We establish the mapping as an exact and efficient tool for numerical analysis: using it, the computational effort required to study a system of width \$M\$ is proportional to \$M{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$, and not exponential in \$M\$ as with conventional algorithms. We show how the approach may be used to calculate for the RBIM: the free energy; typical correlation lengths in quasi-one dimension for both the spin and the disorder operators; even powers of spin-spin correlation functions and their disorder-averages. We examine in detail the square-lattice, nearest-neighbour \${\textbackslash}pm J\$ RBIM, in which bonds are independently antiferromagnetic with probability \$p\$, and ferromagnetic with probability \$1-p\$. Studying temperatures \$T{\textbackslash}geq 0.4J\$, we obtain precise coordinates in the \$p-T\$ plane for points on the phase boundary between ferromagnet and paramagnet, and for the multicritical (Nishimori) point. We demonstrate scaling flow towards the pure Ising fixed point at small \$p\$, and determine critical exponents at the multicritical point.},

Interest has since been growing in the area of quantum computation. One of the main difficulties of quantum computation is that decoherence destroys the information in a superposition of states contained in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. It is shown how to reduce the effects of decoherence for information stored in quantum memory, assuming that the decoherence process acts independently on each of the bits stored in memory.

This leads to a discussion of error correction in a quantum communication channel or a quantum computer. Methods of error correction in the quantum regime are presented, and their limitations assessed. A quantum channel can recover from arbitrary decoherence of x qubits if K bits of quantum information are encoded using n quantum bits, where K /n can be greater than 1 - 2H(2x/n), but must be less than 1 - 2H(2x/n) This implies exponential reduction of decoherence with only a polynomial increase in the computing resources required. Therefore quantum computation can be made free of errors in the presence of physically realistic levels of decoherence. The methods also allow isolation of quantum communication from noise and evesdropping (quantum privacy amplification).},

However, for gates which correspond to sufficiently large rotations of the qubit register, we find that the qualitative nature of these noise terms can vary significantly from the nature of the noise at the underlying hardware level. The bulk of our analysis is directed towards analyzing what we refer to as the separability ansatz, which is an ansatz concerning the manner in which individual quantum operations acting on a quantum system can be approximated.

	abstract = {We numerically study coherent errors in surface codes on planar graphs, focusing on noise of the form of \$Z\$- or \$X\$-rotations of individual qubits. We find that, similarly to the case of incoherent bit- and phase-flips, a trade-off between resilience against coherent \$X\$- and \$Z\$-rotations can be made via the connectivity of the graph. However, our results indicate that, unlike in the incoherent case, the error-correction thresholds for the various graphs do not approach a universal bound. We also study the distribution of final states after error correction. We show that graphs fall into three distinct classes, each resulting in qualitatively distinct final-state distributions. In particular, we show that a graph class exists where the logical-level noise exhibits a decoherence threshold slightly above the error-correction threshold. In these classes, therefore, the logical level noise above the error-correction threshold can retain significant amount of coherence even for large-distance codes. To perform our analysis, we develop a Majorana-fermion representation of planar-graph surface codes and describe the characterization of logical-state storage using fermion-linear-optics-based simulations. We thereby generalize the approach introduced for the square lattice by Bravyi {\textbackslash}textit\{et al\}. [npj Quantum Inf. 4, 55 (2018)] to surface codes on general planar graphs.},

Only degenerate codes with the maximal stabilizer weight much smaller than their minimum distance are considered. It is shown that with the help of OSD-like post-processing the performance of the standard belief propagation (BP) decoder on many QLDPC codes can be improved by several orders of magnitude. Using this new BP-OSD decoder we study the performance of several known classes of degenerate QLDPC codes including hypergraph product codes, hyperbicycle codes, homological product codes, and Haah's cubic codes. We also construct several interesting examples of short generalized bicycle codes. Some of them have an additional property that their syndromes are protected by small BCH codes, which may be useful for the fault-tolerant syndrome measurement. We also propose a new large family of QLDPC codes that contains the class of hypergraph product codes, where one of the used parity-check matrices is square. It is shown that in some cases such codes have better performance than hypergraph product codes. Finally, we demonstrate that the performance of the proposed BP-OSD decoder for some of the constructed codes is better than for a relatively large surface code decoded by a near-optimal decoder.},

For Pauli channels, this task can be accomplished by a version of the belief propagation algorithm used for decoding sparse classical codes. Quantum codes pose two new challenges however. Firstly, their Tanner graph unavoidably contain small loops which typically undermines the performance of belief propagation. Secondly, sparse quantum codes are by definition highly degenerate. The standard belief propagation algorithm does not exploit this feature, but rather it is impaired by it. We propose heuristic methods to improve belief propagation decoding, specifically targeted at these two problems. While our results exhibit a clear improvement due to the proposed heuristic methods, they also indicate that the main source of errors in the quantum coding scheme remains in the decoding.},

	abstract = {Surface codes are generally studied based on the assumption that each of the qubits that make up the surface code lattice suffers noise that is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, real benchmarks of the individual relaxation (\$T\_1\$) and dephasing (\$T\_2\$) times of the constituent qubits of state-of-the-art quantum processors have recently shown that the decoherence effects suffered by each particular qubit actually vary in intensity. In consequence, in this article we introduce the independent non-identically distributed (i.ni.d.) noise model, a decoherence model that accounts for the non-uniform behaviour of the docoherence parameters of qubits. Additionally, we use the i.ni.d model to study how it affects the performance of a specific family of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes known as planar codes. For this purpose we employ data from four state-of-the-art superconducting processors: ibmq{\textbackslash}\_brooklyn, ibm{\textbackslash}\_washington, Zuchongzhi and Rigetti Aspen-M-1. Our results show that the i.i.d. noise assumption overestimates the performance of surface codes, which can suffer up to \$95{\textbackslash}\%\$ performance decrements in terms of the code pseudo-threshold when they are subjected to the i.ni.d. noise model. Furthermore, we consider and describe two methods which enhance the performance of planar codes under i.ni.d. noise. The first method involves a so-called re-weighting process of the conventional minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, while the second one exploits the relationship that exists between code performance and qubit arrangement in the surface code lattice. The optimum qubit configuration derived through the combination of the previous two methods can yield planar code pseudo-threshold values that are up to \$650{\textbackslash}\%\$ higher than for the traditional MWPM decoder under i.ni.d. noise.},

In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a \$c{\textasciicircum}3\$ locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.},

An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however, for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures.},

              Practical quantum computing will require error rates well below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction
              1,2
              offers a path to algorithmically relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, for which increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across several code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find that our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, in terms of both logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ((2.914 ± 0.016)\% compared to (3.028 ± 0.023)\%). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a 1.7 × 10
              −6
              logical error per cycle floor set by a single high-energy event (1.6 × 10
              −7
              excluding this event). We accurately model our experiment, extracting error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark an experimental demonstration in which quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

We present circuit-level schemes for extracting the error syndrome of these codes fault-tolerantly. We further present an integer-program-based decoding algorithm for identifying the most likely error given the syndrome. We simulated our syndrome extraction and decoding algorithms against three physically-motivated noise models using Monte Carlo methods, and used the simulations to estimate the corresponding accuracy thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum error correction. We also used a self-avoiding walk analysis to lower-bound the accuracy threshold for two of these noise models. We present and analyze two architectures for fault-tolerantly computing with these codes: one with 2D arrays of qubits are stacked atop each other and one in a single 2D substrate. Our analysis demonstrates that color codes perform slightly better than Kitaev's surface codes when circuit details are ignored. When these details are considered, we estimate that color codes achieve a threshold of 0.082(3)\%, which is higher than the threshold of \$1.3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ achieved by concatenated coding schemes restricted to nearest-neighbor gates in two dimensions but lower than the threshold of 0.75\% to 1.1\% reported for the Kitaev codes subject to the same restrictions. Finally, because the behavior of our decoder's performance for two of the noise models we consider maps onto an order-disorder phase transition in the three-body random-bond Ising model in 2D and the corresponding random-plaquette gauge model in 3D, our results also answer the Nishimori conjecture for these models in the negative: the statistical-mechanical classical spin systems associated to the 4.8.8 color codes are counterintuitively more ordered at positive temperature than at zero temperature.},

          ,
            The construction of a quantum computer remains a fundamental scientific and technological challenge because of the influence of unavoidable noise. Quantum states and operations can be protected from errors through the use of protocols for quantum computing with faulty components. We present a quantum error-correcting code in which one qubit is encoded in entangled states distributed over seven trapped-ion qubits. The code can detect one bit flip error, one phase flip error, or a combined error of both, regardless on which of the qubits they occur. We applied sequences of gate operations on the encoded qubit to explore its computational capabilities. This seven-qubit code represents a fully functional instance of a topologically encoded qubit, or color code, and opens a route toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

	abstract = {We study the +/- J random-plaquette Z\_2 gauge model (RPGM) in three spatial dimensions, a three-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional +/- J random-bond Ising model (RBIM). The model is a pure Z\_2 gauge theory in which randomly chosen plaquettes (occuring with concentration p) have couplings with the ``wrong sign'' so that magnetic flux is energetically favored on these plaquettes. Excitations of the model are one-dimensional ``flux tubes'' that terminate at ``magnetic monopoles.'' Electric confinement can be driven by thermal fluctuations of the flux tubes, by the quenched background of magnetic monopoles, or by a combination of the two. Like the RBIM, the RPGM has enhanced symmetry along a ``Nishimori line'' in the p-T plane (where T is the temperature). The critical concentration p\_c of wrong-sign plaquettes at the confinement-Higgs phase transition along the Nishimori line can be identified with the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information using topological error-correcting codes: if qubit phase errors, qubit bit-flip errors, and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at rates below p\_c, then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly from damage in the limit of a large code block. Numerically, we measure p\_\{c0\}, the critical concentration along the T=0 axis (a lower bound on p\_c), finding p\_\{c0\}=.0293 +/- .0002. We also measure the critical concentration of antiferromagnetic bonds in the two-dimensional RBIM on the T=0 axis, finding p\_\{c0\}=.1031 +/-.0001. Our value of p\_\{c0\} is incompatible with the value of p\_c=.1093 +/-.0002 found in earlier numerical studies of the RBIM, in disagreement with the conjecture that the phase boundary of the RBIM is vertical (parallel to the T axis) below the Nishimori line.},

In this paper, we discuss strategies for surface-code quantum computing on small, intermediate and large scales. They are strategies for space-time trade-offs, going from slow computations using few qubits to fast computations using many qubits. Our schemes are based on surface-code patches, which not only feature a low space cost compared to other surface-code schemes, but are also conceptually simple{\textasciitilde}--{\textasciitilde}simple enough that they can be described as a tile-based game with a small set of rules. Therefore, no knowledge of quantum error correction is necessary to understand the schemes in this paper, but only the concepts of qubits and measurements.},

The surface codes on various lattices are found to be efficient in the sense that their threshold values universally approach the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound. We find that the error-tolerance of surface codes depends on the connectivity of underlying lattices; the error chains on a lattice of lower connectivity are easier to correct. On the other hand, the loss-tolerance of surface codes exhibits an opposite behavior; the logical information on a lattice of higher connectivity has more robustness against qubit loss. As a result, we come upon a fundamental trade-off between error- and loss-tolerances in the family of the surface codes with different lattice geometries.},

	abstract = {In this work we develop a general tensor network decoder for 2D codes. Specifically, we propose a decoder that approximates maximally likelihood decoding for 2D stabiliser and subsystem codes subject to Pauli noise. For a code consisting of \$n\$ qubits our decoder has a runtime of \$O(n{\textbackslash}log n+n{\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}3)\$, where \${\textbackslash}chi\$ is an approximation parameter. We numerically demonstrate the power of this decoder by studying four classes of codes under three noise models, namely regular surface codes, irregular surface codes, subsystem surface codes and colour codes, under bit-flip, phase-flip and depolarising noise. We show that the thresholds yielded by our decoder are state-of-the-art, and numerically consistent with optimal thresholds where available, suggesting that the tensor network decoder well approximates optimal decoding in all these cases. Novel to our decoder is an efficient and effective approximate contraction scheme for arbitrary 2D tensor networks, which may be of independent interest. We have also released an implementation of this algorithm as a stand-alone Julia package: SweepContractor.jl.},

Rev. Lett. 108, 180501 (2012)]. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 160503 (2012)] is able to achieve lower logical error rates and higher thresholds than MWPM, but requires a classical runtime complexity, which is super-polynomial in 𝐿, the linear size of the code. In this work we present an MCMC algorithm that achieves significantly lower logical error rates than MWPM at the cost of a runtime complexity increased by a factor 𝑂⁡(𝐿2). This advantage is due to taking correlations between bit- and phase-flip errors (as they appear, for example, in depolarizing noise) as well as entropic factors (i.e., the numbers of likely error paths in different equivalence classes) into account. For depolarizing noise with error rate 𝑝, we present an efficient algorithm for which the logical error rate is suppressed as 𝑂⁡((𝑝/3)𝐿/2) for 𝑝→0—an exponential improvement over all previously existing efficient algorithms. Our algorithm allows for tradeoffs between runtime and achieved logical error rates as well as for parallelization, and can be also used for correction in the case of imperfect stabilizer measurements.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2102.06132},
	abstract = {Realizing the potential of quantum computing will require achieving sufficiently low logical error rates. Many applications call for error rates in the \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ regime, but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. Quantum error correction (QEC) promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits so that errors can be detected and corrected. Logical errors are then exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold. QEC also requires that the errors are local and that performance is maintained over many rounds of error correction, two major outstanding experimental challenges. Here, we implement 1D repetition codes embedded in a 2D grid of superconducting qubits which demonstrate exponential suppression of bit or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round by more than \$100{\textbackslash}times\$ when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analyzing error correlations with high precision, and characterize the locality of errors in a device performing QEC for the first time. Finally, we perform error detection using a small 2D surface code logical qubit on the same device, and show that the results from both 1D and 2D codes agree with numerical simulations using a simple depolarizing error model. These findings demonstrate that superconducting qubits are on a viable path towards fault tolerant quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent one of the most vital theoretical aspects of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large-scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large-scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. The development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},

	abstract = {Achieving practical quantum advantage requires a classical decoding algorithm to identify and correct faults during computation. This classical decoding algorithm must deliver both accuracy and speed, but in what combination? When is a decoder "fast enough" or "accurate enough"? In the case of surface codes, tens of decoding algorithms have been proposed, with different accuracies and speeds. However, it has been unclear how to choose the best decoder for a given quantum architecture. Should a faster decoder be used at the price of reduced accuracy? Or should a decoder sacrifice accuracy to fit within a given time constraint? If a decoder is too slow, it may be stopped upon reaching a time bound, at the price of some time-out failures and an increased failure rate. What then is the optimal stopping time of the decoder? By analyzing the speed vs. accuracy tradeoff, we propose strategies to select the optimal stopping time for a decoder for different tasks. We design a protocol to select the decoder that minimizes the spacetime cost per logical gate, for logical computation of a given depth. Our protocol enables comparison of different decoders, and the selection of an appropriate decoder for a given fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture. We illustrate our protocol for the surface code equipped with a desktop implementation of the PyMatching decoder. We estimate PyMatching is fast enough to implement thousands of logical gates with a better accuracy than physical qubits. However, we find it is not sufficiently fast to reach 10{\textasciicircum}5 logical gates, under certain assumptions, due to the decoding delay which forces qubits to idle and accumulate errors while idling. We expect further improvements to PyMatching are possible by running it on a better machine or by reducing the OS interference.},

	abstract = {Quantum technologies have the potential to solve certain computationally hard problems with polynomial or super-polynomial speedups when compared to classical methods. Unfortunately, the unstable nature of quantum information makes it prone to errors. For this reason, quantum error correction is an invaluable tool to make quantum information reliable and enable the ultimate goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Surface codes currently stand as the most promising candidates to build near term error corrected qubits given their two-dimensional architecture, the requirement of only local operations, and high tolerance to quantum noise. Decoding algorithms are an integral component of any error correction scheme, as they are tasked with producing accurate estimates of the errors that affect quantum information, so that they can subsequently be corrected. A critical aspect of decoding algorithms is their speed, since the quantum state will suffer additional errors with the passage of time. This poses a connundrum, where decoding performance is improved at the expense of complexity and viceversa. In this review, a thorough discussion of state-of-the-art decoding algorithms for surface codes is provided. The target audience of this work are both readers with an introductory understanding of the field as well as those seeking to further their knowledge of the decoding paradigm of surface codes. We describe the core principles of these decoding methods as well as existing variants that show promise for improved results. In addition, both the decoding performance, in terms of error correction capability, and decoding complexity, are compared. A review of the existing software tools regarding surface codes decoding is also provided.},

	abstract = {We implement a quantum error correction algorithm for bit-flip errors on the topological toric code using deep reinforcement learning. An action-value Q-function encodes the discounted value of moving a defect to a neighboring site on the square grid (the action) depending on the full set of defects on the torus (the syndrome or state). The Q-function is represented by a deep convolutional neural network. Using the translational invariance on the torus allows for viewing each defect from a central perspective which significantly simplifies the state space representation independently of the number of defect pairs. The training is done using experience replay, where data from the algorithm being played out is stored and used for mini-batch upgrade of the Q-network. We find performance which is close to, and for small error rates asymptotically equivalent to, that achieved by the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching algorithm for code distances up to \$d=7\$. Our results show that it is possible for a self-trained agent without supervision or support algorithms to find a decoding scheme that performs on par with hand-made algorithms, opening up for future machine engineered decoders for more general error models and error correcting codes.},

	abstract = {The maximum likelihood (ML) decoder in the two-dimensional surface code with generic unitary errors is governed by a statistical mechanics model with complex weights, which can be simulated via (1+1)D transfer matrix contraction. Information loss with an increasing error rate manifests as a ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition in the contraction dynamics. In this work, we establish entanglement as a separate obstruction to decoding; it can undergo a transition from area- to volume-law scaling in the transfer matrix contraction with increasing unitary error rate. In particular, the volume-law entanglement can coexist with ferromagnetic order, giving rise to a phase in which the encoded information is retained yet is effectively undecodable. We numerically simulate the ML decoding in the surface code subject to both single- and two-qubit Pauli-X rotations and obtain a phase diagram that contains a ferromagnetic area-law, a paramagnetic volume-law, and a potential ferromagnetic volume-law phase. We further show that, starting from the paramagnetic volume-law phase, tilting the single-qubit rotation away from the X-axis couples the stat-mech models for X and Z errors and can lead to a ferromagnetic volume-law phase in which, although Z errors remain correctable, the encoded classical information is hard to recover. To perform numerical simulations, we develop an algorithm for syndrome sampling based on the isometric tensor network representation of the surface code.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2410.22436},
	abstract = {The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the \$X\$ or \$Z\$ axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds \${\textbackslash}alpha\_{\textbackslash}text\{th\}\$. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error correcting phase, \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textless}{\textbackslash}alpha\_{\textbackslash}text\{th\}\$, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix -- a non-unitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit -- can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states. Based on this approach, (ii) we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The \${\textbackslash}alpha\_{\textbackslash}text\{th\}\$ values we find show that the maximum likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.},

	abstract = {We give a broad generalisation of the mapping, originally due to Dennis, Kitaev, Landahl and Preskill, from quantum error correcting codes to statistical mechanical models. We show how the mapping can be extended to arbitrary stabiliser or subsystem codes subject to correlated Pauli noise models, including models of fault tolerance. This mapping connects the error correction threshold of the quantum code to a phase transition in the statistical mechanical model. Thus, any existing method for finding phase transitions, such as Monte Carlo simulations, can be applied to approximate the threshold of any such code, without having to perform optimal decoding. By way of example, we numerically study the threshold of the surface code under mildly correlated bit-flip noise, showing that noise with bunching correlations causes the threshold to drop to \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{corr\}\}=10.04(6){\textbackslash}\%\$, from its known iid value of \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{iid\}\}=10.917(3){\textbackslash}\%\$. Complementing this, we show that the mapping also allows us to utilise any algorithm which can calculate/approximate partition functions of classical statistical mechanical models to perform optimal/approximately optimal decoding. Specifically, for 2D codes subject to locally correlated noise, we give a linear-time tensor network-based algorithm for approximate optimal decoding which extends the MPS decoder of Bravyi, Suchara and Vargo.},

              also make threshold extractions, from numerical calculations at moderate code distances, unreliable. We show that calculating thresholds based not only on the total logical failure rate, but also independently on the phase- and bit-flip logical failure rates, gives a more confident estimate. Using this method for the XZZX code with a tensor-network based decoder and code distances up to

	abstract = {Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information from decoherence as long as error rates fall below critical error thresholds. In general, obtaining thresholds implies simulating the QEC procedure using, in general, suboptimal decoding strategies. In a few cases and for sufficiently simple noise models, optimal decoding of QEC codes can be framed as a phase transition in disordered classical spin models. In both situations, accurate estimation of thresholds demands intensive computational resources. Here we use the coherent information of the mixed state of noisy QEC codes to accurately estimate the associated optimal QEC thresholds already from small-distance codes at moderate computational cost. We show the effectiveness and versatility of our method by applying it first to the topological surface and color code under bit-flip and depolarizing noise. We then extend the coherent information based methodology to phenomenological and quantum circuit level noise settings. For all examples considered, we obtain highly accurate estimates of optimal error thresholds from small, low-distance instances of the codes, in close agreement with threshold values reported in the literature. Our findings establish the coherent information as a reliable competitive  tool for the calculation of optimal thresholds of state-of-the-art QEC codes under realistic noise models.
